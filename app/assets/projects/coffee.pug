                | Just over two years ago to this day, during finals week of my Sophomore year at the University of Southern California, I was introduced to good coffee. At first, it was a purely practical affair: caffeine to keep pushing past the late hours of studying. But over the months since then I have developed an affinity for coffee of all kinds, its morning ritual, and most enjoyably the weekly treks to coffee shops from K Town to Larchmont.

                | Fortunate to have jobs that could be worked remotely during the school year, I‚Äôve had many opportunities to scour LA for the best coffee shops to flip open my laptop and work. But often I‚Äôve found just the right spot difficult to find, mainly because there are criteria that, as a student, I'm looking for. It's a bit of a goldilocks dilemma. For me, Yelp was too general and didn‚Äôt satisfy some of the general constraints of a college student in a coffee shop: Is it good for group project meetings? How fast is the wifi up/down? Where are the outlets? Refills on the coffee? Will the owners look at me weird after I‚Äôve been there for a fortnight?
