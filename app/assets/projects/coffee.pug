                | Just over two years ago to this day, during finals week of my second year at the University of Southern California, I was introduced to good coffee. At first, it was a purely practical affair: caffeine to keep pushing past the late hours of studying. But over the months since then I have developed an affinity for coffee of all kinds, its morning ritual, and most enjoyably the weekly treks to coffee shops from K Town to Larchmont. Enjoy the list!
