                | A few months ago, my friends Landon and Mimi and I were thinking deeply about consumer behavior around food. We got so excited about what the future of delivery and plant-based foods looked like that we tinkered with the idea of starting a food company ourselves. Out of those discussions I decided to create a set of questions designed to learn more about what food means to other people our age and up.

            h6 This is my final assignment at the #[+link('http://iovine-young.usc.edu', 'Iovine & Young Academy', "Undergrad program at USC. Took me a while to get this: pronounced 'I-owe-veen'")] before I graduate. The output of this project will be a web data visualization and case study on new trends in the food space.
