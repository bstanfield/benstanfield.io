            | As my first internship in college, Bonsai provided great foundational knowledge for me in regard to how young companies operate, how employees are motivated, and how work gets done on a blistering timeline. As a design and development intern I got experience working with clients on beta products, like Integrity, an application using Bonsai‚Äôs tech to spot breaches of truth in legal language.

            | Recently, Bonsai was acquired by Microsoft and is merging with the growing ecosystem of artificial intelligence units within the giant company. But while I was working there in 2016, the technology was in the very early stage and the systems we were designing were completely novel. I'm extremeley greatful for the opportunity to learn more about design and engineering, as well as receive a <i>crazy</i> crash course in artificial intelligence. My time at Bonsai inspired me to apply for the role of president of Spark SC just a few months later, and to help launch the Laudato Si' Challenge the next summer.
