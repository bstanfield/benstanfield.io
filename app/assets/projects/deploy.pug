          That's it! Our sample project has been deployed to the outputted link (now in your clipboard). Anyone on the internet can view that link.

          # What's next?
          We've accomplished a very quick and easy deployment to the web! But the `.sh` output URL of a Now deployment isn't ideal for your website. Ideally, you want to deploy to your custom domain. So this leaves a couple options...

            # 1. Browse
            ## But why browse on Zeit?
            There are a lot of companies that will sell you a domainâ€”GoDaddy, Namecheap, FreeDNS, Google Domains, etc.â€”so what makes one better than the next? Here's one reason: Some domain registrars [leak your domain search history](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2326790), which can result in your preferred domain being taken before you're ready to pay. 
            > Note: If you already have your domain, check out [Zeit's guide](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/domains-and-aliases/adding-a-domain) for migrating an existing domain to Zeit, and then return to Step 3 of this chapter.
            >
            Zeit **guarantees** that no searches made on their site will be shared, so search away! Plus, buying a domain through Zeit makes *deploying* your site through Zeit (see part one) that much easier. Here are some other benefits of buying through Zeit:
            >
            - Free SSL certification
            - Free WHOIS privacy
            - Built-in **Zeit Now** integration
            - Free DNS (Your site will work across the globe, among [other things](https://zeit.co/network))
