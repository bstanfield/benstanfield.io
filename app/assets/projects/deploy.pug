          That's it! Our sample project has been deployed to the outputted link (now in your clipboard). Anyone on the internet can view that link.

          # What's next?
          *Technically* we've accomplished a very quick and easy deployment to the web! But the `.sh` output URL of a Now deployment isn't ideal for your website. Ideally, you want to deploy to your custom domain. So this leaves a couple options...

            # 1. Browse
            ## But why browse on Zeit?
            There are a lot of companies that will sell you a domainâ€”GoDaddy, Namecheap, FreeDNS, Google Domains, etc.â€”so what makes one better than the next? Here's one reason: Some domain registrars **share your domain search history** with squatters that will swoop in and buy domains before you can make a decision.
            > Note: If you already have your domain, [check out my guide](./migrate-domain.html) for migrating an existing domain to Zeit.
            >
            Zeit **guarantees** that no searches made on their site will be shared, so search away! Plus, buying a domain through Zeit makes *deploying* your site through Zeit (see part one) that much easier. Here are some other benefits of buying through Zeit:
