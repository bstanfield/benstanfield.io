                | It took me over a year and a half of working on #[+link('https://wren.co', 'Wren')] to finally sit down and read <i>Drawdown</i>, a seminal text on climate solutions. Despite all of the websites and companies that cite the book's solutions, most people chaffe at actually sitting down and reading the whole thing, front to back. And rightfully so, as the book is more akin to a textbook than a novel.

            h6
                | So, I decided to make the experience more fun for myself by boiling down some of the solutions into a few sentences. I hope this helps you get excited about a particular solution, so much so that you purchase <i>Drawdown</i> and give reading it a try!
