              # The Map That Changed the World 
              The Map that Changed the World is a 2001 book by Simon Winchester about English geologist William Smith and his great achievement, the first geological map of England, Wales and southern Scotland. Smith's was the first national-scale geological map, and by far the most accurate of its time.

          That's it! Our sample project has been deployed to the outputted link (now in your clipboard). Anyone on the internet can view that link.

          # What's next?
          We've accomplished a very quick and easy deployment to the web! But the `.sh` output URL of a Now deployment isn't ideal for your website. Ideally, you want to deploy to your custom domain. So this leaves a couple options...

            # 1. Browse
            ## But why browse on Zeit?
            There are a lot of companies that will sell you a domainâ€”GoDaddy, Namecheap, FreeDNS, Google Domains, etc.â€”so what makes one better than the next? Here's one reason: Some domain registrars [leak your domain search history](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2326790), which can result in your preferred domain being taken before you're ready to pay. 
            > Note: If you already have your domain, check out [Zeit's guide](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/domains-and-aliases/adding-a-domain) for migrating an existing domain to Zeit, and then return to Step 3 of this chapter.
            >
            Zeit **guarantees** that no searches made on their site will be shared, so search away! Plus, buying a domain through Zeit makes *deploying* your site through Zeit (see part one) that much easier. Here are some other benefits of buying through Zeit:
            >
            - Free SSL certification
            - Free WHOIS privacy
            - Built-in **Zeit Now** integration
            - Free DNS (Your site will work across the globe, among [other things](https://zeit.co/network))
