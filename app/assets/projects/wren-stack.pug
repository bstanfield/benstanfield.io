            | In May of 2019, I launched #[+link('https://projectwren.com', 'Project Wren')], a platform for crowdfunding solutions to climate change, with my two co-founders #[+link('https://twitter.com/landonsbrand', 'Landon Brand')] and #[+link('https://twitter.com/mims_tz', 'Mimi Tran Zambetti')]. In the past year we've tried dozens of software and services to make the work we do more joyful and organized. When we started Wren, we'd just graduated college and entered Y Combinator. I'm going to take you through a (mostly) exhaustive breakdown of what services we can't live without, how much we pay for them, and how it all adds up and impacts our runway.

            Often times, a "company" starts well before it's technically incorporated. But when the day comes, it can be a daunting task. Stripe Atlas was an easy and no-brainer decision for us. We'd never touched legal documents for a company before, and Atlas holds your hand through it all.

            We use Notion everyday for note-taking, personal kanban boards, and as a company wiki. If there's a new company practice we want to codify, it ends up in Notion. If someone's on a call with a user, those notes ends up in Notion. Notion is a swiss-army knife for storing information because everything is organized in databases. What makes Notion fun is that there's no tradeoff between structure and creativity‚Äîyou can type and build and drag smoothly across notes and tables and images.
