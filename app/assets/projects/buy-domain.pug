            # Objective
            Browse and buy a domain on **Zeit Domains** and connect it to the project we deployed in [part one](./deploy.html).

            # Step 1: Browse
            ## But why browse on Zeit?
            There are a lot of companies that will sell you a domainâ€”GoDaddy, Namecheap, FreeDNS, Google Domains, etc.â€”so what makes one better than the next? Here's one reason: Some domain registrars **share your domain search history** with squatters that will swoop in and buy domains before you can make a decision.
            > Note: If you already have your domain, [check out my guide](./migrate-domain.html) for migrating an existing domain to Zeit.
            >
            Zeit **guarantees** that no searches made on their site will be shared, so search away! Plus, buying a domain through Zeit makes *deploying* your site through Zeit (see part one) that much easier. Here are some other benefits of buying through Zeit:
            >
            - Free SSL certification
            - Free WHOIS privacy
            - Built-in **Zeit Now** integration
            - Free DNS (Your site will work across the globe, among [other things](https://zeit.co/network))

            > 
            ## Find a domain
            To start looking for your domain, visit [Zeit.co/domains](https://zeit.co/domains)
