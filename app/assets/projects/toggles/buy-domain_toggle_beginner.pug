    # Part 2: Buy
    Once you've found your domain, click on it to buy. You might need to enter credit card information on Zeit if you haven't yet.

    After purchasing, navigate to your dashboard and click on the **Domains** section. You should see a list of all your domains there (likely just the one that you bought).

    # Publish your content!
    The last step to having a fully-functioning website is to connect, or **alias**, the content from earlier in the tutorial.
    > 
    To alias a deployment, visit zeit.co/dashboard. You should see a list of your project(s). Click into the simple project (mine is called zeitApp) you deployed earlier and select the most recent deployment URL. Alias it with your custom domain, or some variant of your domain name (like `blog.yourwebsite.com`).

    Now, whenever you want to update your site, drag your folder into the Now app, check out the deployment URL to make sure everything looks right, and alias it from your dashboard.
