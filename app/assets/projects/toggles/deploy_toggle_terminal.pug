  # Objective (Advanced)
  To learn a simple, elegant deployment process for publishing web content that works for beginners *and* experienced developers ðŸ¤–.

  # Step 1: Create a new directory (folder)
  Disclaimer: Using the `command line` to run Zeit and deploy your website is not required, but I highly recommend trying it out. I'll be writing out commands that you can **copy + paste**, and I also have a [cheatsheet](https://benstanfield.io) for command line prompts in case you get stuck.

  [But... why should I use command line?](https://benstanfield.io)
  ## Open Terminal
  All macs have the program **Terminal** installed by default. Open it, type `ls`, and press enter. You should see a list of files (kind of like a stripped down Finder) as the output.

  To get started with our new project, we'll need to **change directory** (folder) from our root to wherever you want your code to live. You can use the command `cd` to enter an existing directory. For this demo, our project will live on **Desktop.**

pre
  code(class='bash').
    cd Desktop                              <span class="comment">// Enters your Desktop folder</span>
    <span class="hljs-built_in">mkdir</span> sampleProject && cd sampleProject <span class="comment">// Chains two commands: creating and entering a directory</span>

:markdown-it
  Adding files to a directory is easy from the command line. Use the following command to create an **index.html** page to kick off our homepage.

pre
  code(class='bash').
    echo "&lt;h1&gt;I can't wait to be deployed...&lt;/h1&gt;" &gt; index.html

:markdown-it
  Let's open that file up quickly in our browser to make sure it worked.

pre
  code(class='bash').
    <span class="hljs-built_in">open</span> 'index.html'

  # 2. Create a **Zeit** account
  The **Zeit Now** platform is extremely powerful, but for now we can think of Zeit as a **dead-simple hosting service for our static website.** In the next few minutes we'll get deployment of our code to the web working with just one command in Terminal ðŸ˜² .
  >
  **First, visit [zeit.co](https://www.zeit.co/signup) and sign up**
  (choosing "continue with email" is fastest).

+img('../images/projects/dnd/zeit-signup.png', { screenshot: true })

:markdown-it
  When prompted, make sure to install the **Now CLI (Command Line Interface).** This allows us to write commands to deploy our website from Terminal, similar to `cd`, `echo`, and others from earlier.
  >
  To confirm that you're logged in and have Now CLI installed, return to your project directory in Terminal and run this command:

pre
  code(class='bash').
    <span class="hljs-built_in">now</span> --version

:markdown-it
  If all is well, that command should return the version number of your Now CLI.

  # 3. Deploy
  ðŸš¨ We're one step from deployment! Just type the command `now` and your directory sampleProject will be deployed to a **staging URL.** 
  >
  You should see something like this (I'll get back to the warning briefly):

pre
  code(class='bash').
    ben@bs-tb13 zeitApp Â» <span class="hljs-built_in">now</span>
    > WARN! Your project is missing a now.json file with a `version` property. More: https://zeit.co/docs/version-config
