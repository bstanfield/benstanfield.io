# Objective
To learn a simple, elegant deployment process for publishing web content that works for beginners *and* experienced developers.

# Step 1: Create a new directory (folder)
Using the `command line` (called Terminal on Mac) is not required, but I highly recommend trying it out. I'll be writing out commands that you can **copy + paste**, and I also have a [cheatsheet](https://benstanfield.io) for command line prompts in case you get stuck.

## Open Terminal
All macs have the program **Terminal** installed by default. Open it, type `ls`, and press enter. You should see a list of files (kind of like a stripped down Finder) as the output.
