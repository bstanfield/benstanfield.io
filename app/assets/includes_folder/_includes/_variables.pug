                "Prism Coffee is a wonderful, tiny slice of coffee heaven. Robin (the manager) and his staff's attention to detail—mainly for their pour-over and iced coffee—is undeniably the shop's strongsuit, but ample charging, good wifi, and friendly service pushes Prism into my top 20.", "You won't hear much about Prism because of its distance from campus (15 minutes without traffic) and low-profile shop (there isn't much else to do within walking distance). Save Prism for a day when you're craving a great cup of coffee and a nice chat over a long work session."

Their regular lattes are also very good and the service friendly.",

            notes: "Dulce is overall a mixed bag. It produces great food and coffee, but you should never expect to settle there unless you're exceptionally prepared to deal with poor wifi and a tough selection of outlets. Lighting is great, but noise is high, so I go there to do remote work, but not for group projects. Outdoors is a lovely experience in the first months of fall or the bulk of spring. It’s quieter than inside, but there are variables like harsh sun and no power."

That said, it is pricy, especially if you factor in parking/transportation to downtown. Maybe not worth it as an everyday go-to, but it’s hard to beat their workspace or coffee quality."
