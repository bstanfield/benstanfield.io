            I've worked in a few different positions, from designer and developer at #[+link('https://www.bons.ai', 'Bonsai AI', "AI startup in Berkeley recently acquired by Microsoft")] to associate at #[+link('https://www.fresco.vc', 'Fresco Capital', 'Seed and early stage VC ðŸŒ±')], and in leadership positions as president of #[+link('http://www.sparksc.org', 'Spark SC', 'Entrepreneurship and technology club at USC... also my best friends ðŸ˜‰')] and co-founder of Project Wren. I'm deeply interested in the future of capitalism, and how new-age companies will reference social impact alongside their financial bottomline when making decisions.

            I'm thinking a lot right now about #[+link('https://projectwren.com', 'reversing climate change')], Full-stack Javascript development, #[+link('https://ramdajs.com/', 'functional programming')], and basketball. Great design is something I always keep an eye out for.
